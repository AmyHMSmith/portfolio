        <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>I started my IT career as a Documentation Specialist, writing user manuals for complex software and 
            online applications. I achieved a Cisco certification, took lessons in Unix fundamentals, 
            went to university and achieved a first class honours in computer networks. Before completing 
            my university degree, I worked as a network manager in a small ISP.
            </p>
        
            <p>I have always wanted to learn to code well. I have scattered knowledge of programming, 
                html/css/js. I joined the coding bootcamp because I want to learn to code properly, from 
                A to Z - the works. I wish to return to IT, nothing is impossible, and it's never 
                too late.
            </p>
