        <article><h2><i>Hi there, I'm Amy.</i></h2>
        <p>I'm currently a student of the CommandShift coding bootcamp, training to become a junior developer.
        Having worked with servers and networking devices, I wanted to try my hand at programming. I started off 
        with Lua in Roblox, copying pre-set codes and working backwards to understand what they do. I managed to 
        create a very simple environment but it took absolutely ages! I figured it was time to learn about programming 
        properly.
